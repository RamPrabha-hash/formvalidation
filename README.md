#FORM VALIDATION AND CALCULATION 
#The project consists of two main components: a Form Validation Page and a Calculator Page, both designed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for a seamless user experience. The Form Validation Page ensures that users enter valid information before submitting a form. It includes checks for fields like name, email, and password, enforcing correct formats and displaying error messages when necessary. The validation also considers password strength and proper email formatting to enhance security and usability
